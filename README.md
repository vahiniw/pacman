# pacman
I have created a Pacman Project. This project has very similar features to the original pacman game. The player can collect pellets and once it reaches a powerup, the ghost will stop and the pacman can eat the ghost. If the pacman eats the ghost, it wins. Alternatively, the pacman needs to collect all the pellets to win. If the ghost eats the pacman, the pacman has lost a life. The pacman has 3 lives. To run the project, the user must have CMU graphics installed and the supporting images in the same folder. There are no additional libraries that need to be downloaded.
